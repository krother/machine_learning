Hierarchical Clustering
=======================

# 1. create a list of leaf nodes E from all elements you want to cluster
# 2. find the pair of distinct elements (e1, e2) in E with the largest similarity
# 3. create a new internal node that contains e1 and e2
# 4. add the new node to E
# 5. remove e1 and e2 from E
# 6. repeat from 2. until there is only one node in E
