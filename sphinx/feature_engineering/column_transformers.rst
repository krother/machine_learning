ColumnTransformers and Pipelines
================================


ColumnTransformers
------------------

The `ColumnTransformer` class is a central tool to define what Feature Engineering
method should be applied to which column.

To create a `ColumnTransformer`, you need to provide a list of transformers
with a ``(name, method, columns)`` tuple. The simplest transformer, ``passthrough`` 
does nothing to the specified columns. It is defined as follows:

.. code:: python3

   from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

   trans = ColumnTransformer([      
       ('do_nothing', 'passthrough', ['Parch', 'SibSp'])
   ])


Then you need to call ``fit()`` and ``transform()`` on your training data:

.. code:: python3

   trans.fit(Xtrain)                    # DataFrame with titanic data
   Xtrain_fe = trans.transform(Xtrain)  # use this to train your model


But **only** call ``transform()`` with data for testing or prediction, but not ``fit()``
(by the same logic you would not fit your LogReg model on prediction data again):

.. code:: python3

   Xpred_fe = trans.transform(Xpred)    # DataFrame for prediction

The fit/transform logic applies to almost all preprocessing classes in scikit-learn.

.. code:: python3

   from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
   from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

   trans = ColumnTransformer([
       ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, handle_unknown='ignore'), [...]),
       ('missing', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent'), ['Embarked']),
       ('do_nothing', 'passthrough', ['Parch', 'SibSp']),
   ])



Custom Functions
----------------

Many Feature Engineering techniques do not have a scikit class ready.
Some of them highly depend on the dataset.

The ``FunctionTransformer`` allows you to wrap your own code in a function
and plug it into a ``ColumnTransformer``.
Your functions should accept a DataFrame as an argument and return a 2D array.

The following code calculates the length of passenger names as a feature
(maybe people with impressive titles had a better chance to survive):

.. code:: python3

   from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer

   def name_length(df):
       length = df[df.columns[0]].str.len()
       return length.values.reshape(-1, 1)

   name_transformer = FunctionTransformer(name_length)
   name_transformer.fit(X[['name']])
   name_transformer.transform(X[['name']])

you can add the `FunctionTransformer` to the `ColumnTransformer`:

.. code:: python3

   ('name', FunctionTransformer(name_length), ['Name']),



Pipelines
---------

Sometimes, you need to apply two or more preprocessors at once. For example, you might
want to first impute missing values and then scale the column. 

A ``Pipeline`` allows you to run several preprocessors sequentially. You can combine
them as you like. 

.. code:: python3

   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, SimpleImputer
   from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

   impute_and_scale = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(), MinMaxScaler())

   impute_and_scale.fit(X[['Age']])
   impute_and_scale.transform(X[['Age']])


Pipelines can also be included in a ``ColumnTransformer`` just like any other preprocessors.
This applies imputing and scaling sequentially to both the ``Age`` and ``Fare`` column.

.. code:: python3

   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, SimpleImputer
   from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

   impute_and_scale = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(), MinMaxScaler())

   ...
   ('impute and scale', impute_and_scale, ['Age', 'Fare']),
   ...

.. highlights::

   Things to check if your code does not work:

   -  print the shape of the transformed data after each step
   -  transform individul columns and inspect the result
   -  print the data after each step. Does it look as expected?
   -  check whether you call ``fit()`` and ``transform()`` with the right data.
