The system is a binary classifier that predicts whether a transaction was fraudulent or not.
You calculate the accuracy of each model using *training* and *validation* data.

**Interpret the results.**

- validation data: 81%

Model 2
-------
- training data  : 92% 
- validation data: 91%

Model 3
-------
- training data  : 99%
- validation data: 90%
