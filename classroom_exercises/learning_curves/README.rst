Learning Curves
===============

Plotting and interpreting learning curves is the number one skill for diagnosing Deep Learning models.

Here are some typical learning curves. Match them with the description.

Descriptions in correct order (for teachers):

1. Best-case learning curve. Everything OK
2. This model is overfitting
3. This model trains well first but is overfitting after that --> Early Stopping
4. Oscillating curve. This happens. Everything OK
5. Zoom in on the first part of the learning curve --> More epochs
6. Fewer epochs
7. Zoom in on the last part of a learning curve --> re-initialize model
