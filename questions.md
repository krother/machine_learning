#### 1. What is Machine learning?

* statistics on large-scale data sets
* any optimization algorithm
* a computer program that writes other programs
* automatic parameter fitting on a statistical model
   

#### 2. What is a test dataset used for?

* to estimate the error of a model
* to estimate data quality
* to estimate model quality in production
* to estimate the business impact of a model


#### 3. Which is not a good strategy against overfitting?

* obtain more training data
* tune regularization parameters
* increase the number of input features
* use a simpler model


#### 4. Which is a classification method?

* Logistic Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Cross-Validation
* Principal Component Analysis


#### 5. Which is an advantage of Logistic Regression?

* It does not overfit
* It can solve classification and regression problems
* It calculates probabilities
* It does not require feature engineering


#### 6. Which is a disadvantage of a Random Forest model?

* it requires manual feature selection
* it is sensitive to transformation of the data
* it cannot handle non-scalar data
* it requires scaled data
