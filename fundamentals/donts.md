# ML Don'ts 

1. Never evaluate your final model’s performance from your training data
2. Never apply machine learning to your data before EDA
3. Never believe that there is one best algorithm
4. Never believe that correlation is causation
5. Never trust your data too much. You have to be careful about selection bias 
6. Never use accuracy as a classification metric. Use AUC, precision or recall instead depending on your problem
7. Don’t jump into deep learning before machine learning
8. Don’t believe that python is better than R or vice versa. There is no best programming language. These are just tools
9. Don’t rush into the data without defining your problem
10. Don’t learn data science or hashtag#MachineLearning by yourself. This field is a team effort. Ask questions, learn together, share your work, and help others out. You’ll grow faster this way!
